# algorithm_circleops

I've been wanting to apply for a dev position at Circle since last year when a friend sent me the link. 
However, back then, I was still too raw on programming. Since then, I've done a Rails Full Stck Bootcamp
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. (just finished) and the first thing I did was to check if they were still hiring.

And they were. So, I've decided to give it a shot.
I've solved the algorithm and created and rspec to test it. With that, I'm hoping to be able to get an opportunity
at Circle.
